#qbit - Go Channels inspired Java lib. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/advantageous/qbit.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/advantageous/qbit)

Got a question? Ask here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/boonjava QbIt is part of Boon.

Everything is a queue. You have a choice. You can embrace it and control it. You can optimize for it. 
Or you can hide behind abstractions.

QBit opens you up to peeking into what is going on, and allows you to pull some levers without selling your soul.

QBit can be 15x faster than built-in Java queues.

QBit philosiphy:
====
At the end of the day QBit is a simpley library not a framework. 
Your app is not a QBit app but a Java app that uses the QBit lib.
QBit allows you to work with Java UTIL concurrent, and does not endeavor to hide it from you.
Just trying to take the sting out of it. 

Does it work
=====
I think so.
I have used techniques in Boon and QBit with great success in high-end, high-performance, high-scalable apps. 
I have helped clients handle 10x the load with 1/10th the servers of their competitors using techniques in QBit.
QBit is me being sick of hand tuning queue access and threads.
Also I have the same QBit like thing written about 20x times. 
And if I write it one more time, I am going to go insane.
I often twist and turn knobs for each use case, but often forget which knob to tweak in which sceanrio.


Single Writer, Mulit Write with CPU bound writer do this, this and this.
Single Writer, Multi Writer with IO bound writer do this, this and this.
and so on and so on...


Boon and QBit humility policy
=====
Ideas for Boon and QBit often come from all over the web. We make mistakes. Point them out. 
As a developer of Boon and QBit, I am a fellow traveler. 
If you have an idea or technique you want to share, I am all ears. 


Inspiration
====

A big inspireation for Boon/QBit was Go Channels, Active Objects, Apartment Model Threading, Actor, and Mechnical Sympathy papers.
I have read the AKKA in Action Book. It was inpsiring, but not the only inspiration for QBit and not the major inspriation.
QBit has ideas that are similar to many frameworks. 
We are all reading the same papers. 
Most of the inpiration for QBit was the LMAX disruptor papers and this blog http://php.sabscape.com/blog/?p=557.
I had a theory about queues that this blog post (http://php.sabscape.com/blog/?p=557) inprired me to try out. 
 
Does QBit compete with...
====
Spring Disruptor: No. You could use QBit to write plugins for Spring Disruptor I suppose, but QBit does not compete with Spring Disruptor.
Akka: No. Ditto
LMAX Disruptor: No.

```

As you can see, QBIT does quite well. But there is one case where it does not do as well.
The solution is simple. There will be a factory where you can specify number of readers/writers, IO Bound/CPU Bound, etc.
Then QBIT will use the write queue based on the factory params. 
Currently QBIT uses LinkedTransferQueue at the moment. 
Anyway. Check back. Work in progress....

Code Examples

Basic Queue example:

====

```java

     BasicQueue<Integer> queue =  BasicQueue.create(Integer.class, 1000);
    
    //Sending threads
     
     SendQueue<Integer> sendQueue = queue.sendQueue();
     for (int index = 0; index < amount; index++) {
           sendQueue.send(index);
     }
     sendQueue.flushSends();
     ...
     sendQueue.sendAndFlush(code);
     //other methods for sendQueue, writeBatch, writeMany


     //Recieving Threads
     ReceiveQueue<Integer> receiveQueue = queue.receiveQueue();
     Integer item = receiveQueue.take(); 
     //other methods poll(), pollWait(), readBatch(), readBatch(count)
```

Service example:

Let's say you have maps and lists and arrays of gak, and you want invoke methods on a service so maybe you are handling JSON calls with VertX WebSocket support or REST calls with VertX HTTP support (or Servlets, or maybe a file, or a Queue, or... a batch of calls stores in a DB, or... whatever).

Adder.java Service
=====

```java 

    public static class Adder {
        int all;
        int add(int a, int b) {
            int total;

            total = a + b;
            all += total;
            return total;
        }
    }
    
```

To create your service, you first configure in in service.xml, and then you create it with the **factoryFactoryofFactoryService**... just kidding....

Creating your service...

```java

        Adder adder = new Adder();
```

Now wrap your service in a queue handler and you have two options:

```java
        Service service = Services.regularService("test", adder, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, 10);
        SendQueue<MethodCall<Object>> requests = service.requests();
        ReceiveQueue<Response<Object>> responses = service.responses();
```

So since QBit is related to Boon and Boon does high-speed JSON parsing (and marshaling, etc.).

JSON service.. (Now just hook this up with Vertx WebSocket lib of Vertx HTTP and you have a high speed service engine that will beat most and rival others)...


```java
        Service service = Services.jsonService("test", adder, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, 100);
        ReceiveQueue<Response<Object>> responses = service.responses();
        SendQueue<MethodCall<Object>> requests = service.requests();

```

In request thread...
```java
        SendQueue<MethodCall<Object>> requests = service.requests();

        requests.send(MethodCallImpl.method("add", "[1,2]"));
        requests.send(MethodCallImpl.method("add", "[4,5]"));
        requests.flushSends();
        //other methods for sendQueue, writeBatch, writeMany


```

In response thread...
```
        Response<Object> response = responses.take();

        Integer sum = fromJson(response.body().toString());

```




Other ways to send method calls:

JSON

```java

        requests.send(MethodCallImpl.method("add", "[1,2]"));

        requests.send(MethodCallImpl.method("add", "[4,5]"));
        requests.flushSends();

```

No JSON
```
        requests.send(MethodCallImpl.method("add", Lists.list(1, 2)));

        requests.sendAndFlush(MethodCallImpl.methodWithArgs("add", 4, 5));
```

No JSON batch
```

        requests.sendMany(MethodCallImpl.method("add", 
                            Lists.list(1, 2)), 
                        MethodCallImpl.method("add", 
                                Lists.list(4, 5)));


```

JSON Batch
```

        requests.sendMany(
                MethodCallImpl.method("add", "[1,2]"), 
                MethodCallImpl.method("add", "[4,5]"));


```

Another way to batch

No JSON Batch with a list
```
        List<MethodCall<Object>> methods = Lists.list(
                MethodCallImpl.method("add", Lists.list(1, 2)),
                MethodCallImpl.method("add", Lists.list(4, 5)));
        requests.sendBatch(methods);

```
